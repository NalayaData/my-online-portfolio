      - degree: PhD Thesis in Computer Science with a Specialization in AI
        university: University of Paris 8, Saint-Seine-Denis, France
        time: 2012 - 2016
        details: |
          This AI thesis lies at the intersection of two fields: Semantic Web and Machine Learning. 
          The work aims to analyze and predict the empirical behavior of ontology reasoners within the context of real-world ontologies. 
          The research led to the creation of ADSOR, a decision support system based on predictive models that assess the robustness of reasoners and the complexity of ontologies, while also enabling the extraction of complex ontology parts. 
          To achieve this, we implemented a data transformation pipeline and developed various machine learning models. The findings were disseminated at prestigious national and international conferences.

            Real-world experimentation with end-to-end ML on Google Cloud. This specialization have teached me how to:
            - build Vertex AI AutoML models without writing a single line of code; 
            - build BigQuery ML models knowing basic SQL; 
            - create Vertex AI custom training jobs that I deployed using containers using Docker; 
            - use Feature Store for data management and governance; 
            - use feature engineering for model improvement and determine the appropriate data preprocessing options for your use case;
            - use Vertex Vizier hyperparameter tuning to incorporate the right mix of parameters that yields accurate, generalized models and knowledge of the theory to solve specific types of ML problems,
            - use Vertex AI prediction and model monitoring services to help manage the performance of our ML models.
