          This AI thesis lies at the intersection of two fields: Semantic Web and Machine Learning. 
          The work aims to analyze and predict the empirical behavior of ontology reasoners within the context of real-world ontologies. 
          The research led to the creation of ADSOR, a decision support system based on predictive models that assess the robustness of reasoners and the complexity of ontologies, while also enabling the extraction of complex ontology parts. 
          To achieve this, we implemented a data transformation pipeline and developed various machine learning models. The findings were disseminated at prestigious national and international conferences.
